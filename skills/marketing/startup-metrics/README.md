- SaaS-Specific Metrics — revenue composition, retention (NDR, gross, logo), efficiency (magic number, Rule of 40, quick ratio)
- Marketplace Metrics — GMV, take rate, liquidity, repeat rate
- Consumer/Mobile Metrics — DAU/MAU, Day 30 retention, K-factor, NPS
- B2B Sales Metrics — win rate, pipeline coverage, ACV, sales cycle
- Metrics by Stage — pre-seed, seed, Series A, Series B+ focus areas
- Tracking Best Practices — reporting cadence, dashboard format
- What VCs Want to See — metrics by funding round
- Data Infrastructure — requirements and recommended tools
- Metric Calculation Examples — LTV, burn multiple, magic number, quick ratio
