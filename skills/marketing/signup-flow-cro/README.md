# Signup Flow CRO

Optimize signup, registration, and account creation flows. Reduce friction, increase completion rates, and set users up for successful activation.

## What's Inside

- Core Principles — minimize fields, show value before commitment, reduce perceived effort, remove uncertainty
- Field-by-Field Optimization — email, password, name, social auth, phone number
- Single-Step vs. Multi-Step — when to use each with best practices
- Trust and Friction Reduction — form-level trust signals, error handling
- Mobile Signup Optimization — touch targets, keyboard types, autofill
- Post-Submit Experience — success states, verification flows
- Common Signup Flow Patterns — B2B SaaS, B2C App, Waitlist, E-commerce
- Measurement — form start rate, completion rate, field-level drop-off
- Experiment Ideas — form design, authentication, copy, trial models
