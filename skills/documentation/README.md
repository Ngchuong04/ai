# Documentation

Skills for creating and maintaining high-quality technical documentation throughout the software development lifecycle. This category covers architecture decision records, documentation structure and organization, and product requirement specifications — the written artifacts that capture decisions, communicate intent, and align teams before code is written.

## Skills

| Skill | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| [adr-patterns](adr-patterns/) | Lightweight documentation capturing the context, decision, and consequences of significant technical choices. ADRs become the institutional memory of why things are built the way they are. |
| [docs-organization](docs-organization/) | Complete workflow for project documentation including directory structure, docs-first philosophy, and the critical separation between current-state docs and future-state planning. |
| [prd-patterns](prd-patterns/) | Convert persona docs into detailed feature specifications with acceptance criteria, user stories, and priority frameworks that bridge user needs and development work. |
