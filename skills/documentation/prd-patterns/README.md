# Feature Specification & PRD Patterns

Bridge persona documentation and development by translating user needs, pain points, and journeys into structured, implementable feature specifications with clear acceptance criteria. Prevents scope ambiguity before a single line of code is written.

## What's Inside

- Feature specification template (metadata, problem statement, user stories, acceptance criteria)
- Writing effective user stories with the "As a / I want / So that" pattern
- Acceptance criteria patterns (Given/When/Then, checklist, boundary)
- Priority framework (Must / Should / Could / Won't)
- Specification anti-patterns to avoid
- Integration with development workflow
- Edge case and non-functional requirements sections

## When to Use

- After persona docs exist and before development begins
- When a feature request lacks clear acceptance criteria
- When stakeholders disagree on what "done" means
- When converting user feedback into development work
