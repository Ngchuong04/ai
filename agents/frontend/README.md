# Frontend Agent

Autonomous workflow for designing, building, and polishing production-grade frontend interfaces end-to-end. Handles design system setup, component architecture, responsive layouts, accessibility, and performance.

## Workflow Phases

- **Phase 1: Requirements** — UI scope, users, devices, design input, accessibility, content, interactivity; technical constraints
- **Phase 2: Design system** — Design tokens, typography, color, spacing, motion; extend or create
- **Phase 3: Component architecture** — Component tree, composition, state, responsive breakpoints
- **Phase 4: Implementation** — Build components following framework best practices
- **Phase 5: Polish** — Transitions, loading/error/empty states
- **Phase 6: Verification** — Accessibility, responsiveness, visual quality
